PRODIF Documentation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Progressing note (10/01/2014):
At the moment, the software has a nearly complete system of database, without a persistent system yet. The software's look is also nearly done, we are actually putting all these parts to work together.
The DC Diagram is being update because we didn't know some attributes.
